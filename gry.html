<UL>
The most important point in answering this riddle is that it is often
misquoted.  Here is how it is often (incorrectly) phrased:<br>
<br><i>
"There are three words in the English language that end in '-gry'.  One
is 'angry' and another is 'hungry'.  What is the third word?  Everyone
knows what the third word means and what it stands for.  Everyone uses
it everyday, and if you listened carefully, I've already given you the
third word.  What is it?"<br></i>
<br>
I suspect that in passing it along, it became misquoted.  The above
question does not have a satisfactory answer, thus making it so much
grist for the internet mill.  Here is the correct phrasing, followed
by the answer and explanation:<br>
<br><i>
"Two words that end in '-gry' are 'angry' and 'hungry'.  There are three 
words in the English language.  What is the third word?  Everyone knows 
what it means and what it stands for.  Everyone uses it every day.
And if you listened carefully, I've already given you the third word.
What is it?"<br></i>
<br>
The answer is 'language'.  <br>
<br>
The question is a trick of wordplay.   The first sentence about 'gry' 
words is merely there to mislead you.  The pertinent part of the
question is the the second sentence:  "There are three words in the 
English language.  What is the third word?"  The three words are:
'the', 'English', and 'language' and 'language' is the third word and
the answer to the riddle.  'Language' also satisfies the clues that
are given.<br>
<br>
So there you have it.  Now you can sleep at night.
